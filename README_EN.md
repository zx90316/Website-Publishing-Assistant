   - **IP Address**: Server IP address
   - **Username**: SSH login username
   - **Password**: SSH login password

2. Select publishing date (click date field to open calendar)
3. Set publishing time (24-hour format)
4. Click "Set Scheduled Publishing"
5. The application will display:
   - Next publishing time
   - Countdown timer
   - Target server list
6. To cancel, click "Cancel Schedule"

### 3. Merge-Based Deployment Process

The application uses the following steps to ensure deployment safety and completeness:

1. **Configuration Validation**: Check source files, target servers, and network connections
2. **File Conflict Detection**: Check if local files contain files that need protection
3. **Project Structure Creation**: Create project folders for each source directory under the server parent directory
4. **Filtered File Upload**: Skip protected files, upload only necessary update files
5. **Merge Deployment**: Use xcopy (Windows) or rsync (Linux) for intelligent merging
6. **Protect Important Files**: Server's web.config, database files, and other important files are preserved
7. **Feature Updates**: New feature files overwrite old versions for version upgrades
8. **Cleanup Temporary Files**: Clean up temporary files from the deployment process

### 4. Project Folder Structure

Assuming server path is set to `D:\websites` and source files are:
- `C:\projects\website1`
- `C:\projects\website2`

Server structure after deployment:
```
D:\websites\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ website1\
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (updated file)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css (updated file)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web.config (protected server file)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.db (protected server file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ website2\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js (updated file)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json (protected server file)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs\ (protected server directory)
```

This process ensures:
- No service interruption during deployment
- Feature files are properly updated
- Important server configuration files are protected
- Database and log files are not lost

## Configuration File

The application automatically creates a `config.json` file in the execution directory containing all settings:

```json
{
  "source_files": ["list of file or folder paths"],
  "delete_files": ["list of protected file names"],
  "servers": [
    {
      "ip": "server IP",
      "username": "username",
      "password": "password",
      "path": "target parent directory path",
      "port": 22
    }
  ],
  "schedule_time": "scheduled publishing time (ISO format)"
}
```

## Logging System

The application creates log files in the `logs` directory:
- File name format: `publish_YYYYMMDD.log`
- Content includes: connection tests, file uploads, deployment processes, error messages
- Log levels: INFO (general information), WARNING (warnings), ERROR (errors)

## Important Notes

### Security
- Passwords are stored in plain text in the configuration file; ensure file security
- Recommend using dedicated deployment accounts with limited permissions
- Regularly change SSH passwords
- Avoid using in unsecured network environments

### Network Requirements
- Ensure SSH connectivity to target servers
- Firewall must allow SSH port (usually 22)
- Recommended for use in internal network environments
- Supports Chinese character processing in Windows SSH environments

### File Permissions
- Ensure SSH user has write permissions to target paths
- If target path doesn't exist, the application will attempt to create it
- Appropriate file system permissions required in Windows environments

### Testing Recommendations
- Test functionality in a test environment before first use
- Use "Test Connection" and "Test Delete Files" functions to verify settings
- Perform complete backups before important production deployments
- Test functionality correctness using local SSH

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SSH Connection Failure**
   - Check IP address, username, and password
   - Confirm SSH service is running
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **UTF-8 Encoding Errors**
   - Application supports multiple encoding formats
   - Automatically handles Traditional Chinese (CP950) and Simplified Chinese (GBK)
   - If issues persist, check system locale settings

3. **File Upload Failure**
   - Check target path permissions
   - Confirm sufficient disk space
   - Check if files are in use by other processes
   - Confirm SFTP directory creation success

4. **Scheduled Publishing Not Executing**
   - Ensure computer is running at scheduled time
   - Check system time accuracy
   - Verify application hasn't closed unexpectedly
   - Check date setting is in the future

5. **File Conflict Detection Issues**
   - Use "Test Delete Files" function for diagnosis
   - Check file paths and names are correct
   - Confirm local file existence

- Detailed connection error messages
- Reasons for file operation failures
- Complete deployment process records
- Timestamps and error levels
